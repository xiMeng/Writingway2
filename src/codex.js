// Codex module deferred — we removed feature work for now to keep the refactor focused.
// This placeholder keeps the file in place but does not expose any behavior.
// When ready to resume Codex development, replace this stub with the real implementation
// and add the corresponding UI wiring in `main.html` and `src/app.js`.
